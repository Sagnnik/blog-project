Awesome — this is a great question, and you’re right: mid-scale production brings a broad set of concerns beyond “just code”. Below I give a compact, prioritized, practical checklist you can use for a blog or similar app that might get sudden spikes (1000+ concurrent viewers). It covers architecture, DB, API, infra, security, observability, deployments, and runbook actions for a sudden spike. Each item includes short why-it-matters and what-to-do (commands / snippets where useful). Bookmark this — it’s a got-you-covered checklist.

# Quick action if you get 1k+ viewers right now

1. Enable/verify CDN (Cloudflare / Fastly / AWS CloudFront) — serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) from CDN -> immediate load reduction on your origin.
2. Put a caching layer in front of dynamic pages (reverse-proxy cache like Varnish or NGINX cache) or use full-page caching for the blog pages.
3. Temporarily increase app replicas / workers (scale up) or add more Uvicorn/Gunicorn workers.
4. Enable rate limiting for abusive endpoints (login, API writes).
5. Monitor errors & CPU/RAM — if DB is overloaded, enable read replicas or switch to read-only cached responses.
6. If outages persist, enable a “static site fallback” (pre-rendered HTML) or show a maintenance message.

# 1 — Architecture & scaling (how to survive spikes)

* **Use horizontal scaling** (more instances) over one big box.

  * Dockerize app; run on ECS/Fargate, GKE, EKS, or Cloud Run. Use an autoscaler (HPA).
* **Load balancer / reverse proxy** (NGINX, Traefik, cloud LB) in front of app instances.
* **Run multiple worker processes** (e.g., Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers):

  ```
  gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
  ```
* **Use a CDN** for static assets and (if safe) cacheable HTML pages (Cloudflare, CloudFront).
* **Blue/Green or Canary deployments** for safer releases.

---

# 2 — Database (design, scaling, reliability)

* **Use a managed DB** for mid-scale: MongoDB Atlas (Mongo), RDS/Aurora (SQL) — reduces ops overhead.
* **Connection pooling & limits**: configure Motor/PyMongo `maxPoolSize`, and set driver pool per instance so you don’t exhaust DB connections.
* **Read replicas**: offload read-heavy traffic to read replicas.
* **Indexes**: ensure queries are covered by indexes — use `explain()` to detect collection scans.
* **Avoid expensive skip pagination**: use range/seek pagination with indexed fields for large offsets.
* **Cache hotspot data** (Redis) to reduce DB reads.
* **Backups & point-in-time recovery**: enable scheduled backups; test restores.

  * For Mongo local: `mongodump --archive=backup.gz` and `mongorestore --archive=backup.gz`.
* **Schema & data pruning**: limit unbounded collections; TTL indexes for ephemeral data.
* **Capacity planning**: estimate concurrent DB connections = (#instances × maxPoolSize). Ensure DB server allows that.

---

# 3 — Caching & CDN

* **CDN for static**: move images, JS, fonts, CSS to CDN.
* **Reverse proxy HTTP cache**: configure `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Vary` headers; use NGINX or Varnish for full-page caching where appropriate.
* **Object cache (Redis)**:

  * Cache DB queries, computed pages, and API responses.
  * TTL for cached objects (e.g., 30s–5m depending on freshness needs).
* **Cache invalidation strategy**: use topics/events to invalidate (e.g., on content update publish an invalidation).
* **Client-side caching**: short TTLs + stale-while-revalidate when possible.

---

# 4 — API design & resilience

* **Use async I/O** for I/O-bound endpoints (FastAPI + Motor + httpx).
* **Timeouts & retries**:

  * Set request timeouts for external calls.
  * Use exponential backoff and bounded retries.
* **Circuit Breakers** (resilience): open circuit on repeated failures to backend services.
* **Bulkheads**: isolate critical services (separate queues/instances for heavy jobs).
* **Idempotency & safe retries** for POSTs (idempotency keys).
* **Pagination & rate limiting** on list endpoints.

---

# 5 — Rate limiting & abuse protection

* **Rate limit per IP / per user** (use Redis as central store for counts).

  * e.g., `100 requests/min` for anonymous, `1000/min` for authenticated internal clients.
* **Throttle / backoff** for expensive endpoints.
* **WAF + Bot protection**: Cloudflare, AWS WAF to block known bad traffic and DDoS.
* **IP blocking / Geo blocks** where needed.

---

# 6 — Security (must-haves)

* **TLS everywhere** (Let's Encrypt for apps, HTTPS only).
* **Secrets management**: use Vault/Secrets Manager/SSM Parameter Store; never check secrets into git.
* **Authentication & Authorization**:

  * Use JWT/OAuth2 for APIs (short expiry + refresh tokens).
  * RBAC for internal APIs and admin operations.
* **Input validation & output encoding**: use Pydantic models (FastAPI) and sanitize user-generated content (prevent injection and XSS).
* **OWASP best practices**: validate inputs, use prepared statements, avoid unsafe evals.
* **Security headers**: `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`.
* **Rate limit auth endpoints** to prevent credential stuffing.
* **Regular dependency scans** (Snyk, Dependabot).
* **Least privilege** for cloud IAM roles.
* **Logging and alerting for suspicious activity** (login failures, repeated 4xx/5xx).

---

# 7 — Observability: logs, metrics, traces, alerts

* **Centralized logs**: JSON logs to stdout → ship to ELK/CloudWatch/Stackdriver/Datadog.
* **Metrics**: expose Prometheus metrics from app (`prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator`), monitor latency, error rates, CPU/RAM.
* **Tracing**: distributed traces (OpenTelemetry) to visualize request timelines across DB/external calls.
* **SLOs & alerts**: define SLOs (e.g., 99% requests < 500ms). Alert on SLO breaches, error spikes, high CPU.
* **Dashboards**: latency, p50/p95/p99, error counts, request rate, DB connection usage, Redis hit ratio.
* **Health and readiness** endpoints for LB.

---

# 8 — Deployment & CI/CD

* **CI pipeline**: lint, unit tests, integration tests, container build. Run tests in CI and prevent merges with failing tests.
* **CD**: automated deploy to staging; manual or gated to prod. Use blue/green or canary deploys.
* **Immutable artifacts**: use container images with version tags.
* **Rollback strategy**: quick rollback mechanism (previous container image).
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/CloudFormation for reproducible infra.

---

# 9 — Background jobs & async processing

* Offload long or unreliable tasks (emails, image processing) to a task queue:

  * **Celery / RQ / Dramatiq** with Redis/RabbitMQ.
* Make processing idempotent and durable.
* Monitor queue length and worker failures.

---

# 10 — Testing & performance

* **Load testing**: run locust, k6, or JMeter to simulate spikes. Test DB, app, and cache layers.
* **Chaos engineering**: simulate instance or DB failures to ensure graceful degradation.
* **Profiling**: profile endpoints to find hotspots (cProfile, py-spy).

---

# 11 — Cost control & capacity planning

* **Estimate concurrency**: concurrent = RPS × average\_latency. Use this to size workers and DB connections.
* **Plan DB connections**: total DB connections = (#instances × pool\_size) + replicas; ensure DB max\_connections > total.
* **Autoscale** with upper/lower bounds; use cost-aware scaling policies.
* **Cold vs warm start**: pre-warm instances on expected traffic events.

Simple capacity calc example:

* Expected RPS = 200, avg latency = 200ms → concurrent ≈ 40
* If each worker supports 200 concurrency async, 1 worker may suffice—BUT DB pool size and CPU matter.

---

# 12 — Disaster recovery & backups

* **Automated backups** (daily + PITR if supported); test restores quarterly.
* **Cross-region replica** for high availability.
* **Runbook**: documented runbook for incidents (who does what, commands to run, toggles to turn off non-critical features).
* **Failover testing**: practice simulating DB failover.

---

# 13 — Developer ergonomics & safety nets

* **Feature flags** for rolling out features incrementally (LaunchDarkly / Unleash).
* **Dark launches & A/B testing** to reduce risk.
* **Safe defaults**: timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkhead isolation.
* **API versioning** to avoid breaking clients.

# 14 — Practical checklist tailored for a blog (prioritized)

1. Put static assets on CDN (immediate impact).
2. Add Redis caching for blog pages and DB results (cache 30–300s).
3. Configure NGINX cache or Varnish for full-page caching.
4. Run multiple app replicas and autoscale (min 2–3).
5. Use a managed DB (Atlas) with read replicas and backups.
6. Add rate limiting for writes and auth endpoints.
7. Add health checks, logging, and basic alerts (error spike, CPU).
8. Implement graceful degradation: pre-rendered static fallback pages.
9. Enable WAF and basic bot protection.
10. Load test and set SLOs.

---

# 15 — Short command/snippet toolbox (FastAPI + Mongo + Redis)

* Start Gunicorn with 4 workers:

  ```
  gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
  ```
* Redis caching example:

  ```python
  import aioredis, json
  redis = aioredis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")

  async def get_user(id):
      key = f"user:{id}"
      cached = await redis.get(key)
      if cached:
          return json.loads(cached)
      user = await db.users.find_one({"_id": id})
      await redis.set(key, json.dumps(user), ex=60)
      return user
  ```
* Rate limiting using `slowapi` (Redis-backed storage recommended for multiple instances).

---

# 16 — Runbook (what to do when traffic spikes)

1. Verify CDN is enabled and healthy.
2. Check LB and app instance health; scale up replicas if needed.
3. Check Redis hit ratio and switch to fallback if Redis down.
4. Check DB CPU/connection usage — if saturated, flip to read-only or enable read replicas.
5. Temporarily enable increased caching duration and static fallback pages.
6. Enable rate limiting stricter thresholds for anonymous users.
7. If attack suspected, enable WAF rules or block offending IPs or geo-locations.
8. Communicate status on status page/social if outage persists.

---

# Final recommendations (prioritized next steps)

1. CDN + static caching (immediate).
2. Redis for query caching & session store.
3. Managed DB (Atlas) with read replicas and backups.
4. CI/CD with blue/green deploys and health checks.
5. Observability (logs/metrics/traces) + alerts.
6. Load testing and capacity planning.

If you want, I can:

* Create a one-page **runbook** you can keep for incidents (commands + dashboard checks).
* Produce a **docker-compose** sample (FastAPI + Redis + NGINX) tuned for scaling.
* Draft a minimal **infrastructure diagram** and Terraform snippets for a production deployment.

Which of those would help you most right now?
